# Getting Started
To get started with the Lithnet ECMA2 Framework, follow the steps below:

### Step 1: Create a new .NET Framework project
Start by creating a new .NET Framework project. It's important to note that Microsoft Identity Manager does not support .NET Core assemblies.

### Step 2: Add a reference to Microsoft.MetadirectoryServicesEx.dll
Next, add a reference to the `Microsoft.MetadirectoryServicesEx.dll` assembly. This assembly is located on your Microsoft Identity Manager (MIM) server, usually at the following path: `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Forefront Identity Manager\2010\Synchronization Service\Bin\Assemblies`. 

### Step 3: Add the Lithnet.Ecma2Framework NuGet package
To leverage the power of the Lithnet ECMA2 Framework, you need to add the `Lithnet.Ecma2Framework` NuGet package to your project. This package provides the necessary APIs and tools for working with the ECMA2 framework.

You can find the `Lithnet.Ecma2Framework` NuGet package on the NuGet website [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Lithnet.Ecma2Framework/).
